### Introduction
It is an indisputable fact that in this data-driven world getting insightful data visualizations are very important. From small business stores to every big company is using their own preferable visualization platform to gain some insight about their organization. Every platform has its advantages & disadvantages. From all the known platforms Excel, Tableau, PowerBi, and Pandas are very popular. In this article, I will analyze one particular dataset on these four platforms and will conclude my decision about which platform has more edge.

### Data source 
Dataset provider: Washington Post
The Washington Post's database contains records of every fatal shooting in the United States by a police officer in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 2015.

### Vizulization Platforms 
1. Excel
2. Tableau
3. PowerBI
4. Pandas

### All Observations
- Dataset has some missing values. So we can assume that the dataset is not 100% accurate.
- Males were getting shot more than females.
- Age 26 to 45 is the most common age for getting shot. Children and old age people did not commit more dangerous crimes.
- Most of the shootings happen in California State. Additionally, for cities, Los Angeles has the highest shooting count.
- According to the dataset, race “W” is getting more gunshots and race “O” lowest.
- Gun, Knife, and Toy-weapon were the most popular among criminals.
- Most of the individuals did not show any sign of mental illness.
- 65% of the people decided not to run from the police.
- Of all the individuals, 65% of the time individuals identified as a high threat.
- 95% of the time police shot directly instead of shot and tasered.
- We noticed that 85% of the time, the police decided not to use body cameras. We can assume that before few years, wearing a body camera was not that necessary among police.
- According to the dataset, there is a connection between Race and State, Race and Age.
